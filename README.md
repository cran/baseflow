# baseflow

This package computes hydrograph separation using the conceptual automated process from [Pelletier and Andr√©assian, 2020](https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1171-2020). It was developped by the [HYDRO research team](https://webgr.inrae.fr), part of the [HYCAR research unit](https://www6.jouy.inrae.fr/hycar/) and [INRAE institute](https://www.inrae.fr).

*baseflow* is a R package whose computing core is made of a Rust library. Integration was realized through the [extendr](https://github.com/extendr/extendr) API.

Installation and build instructions are available in the INSTALL file.
